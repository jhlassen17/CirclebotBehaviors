This is a fork/pull so I don't screw up our working code.

My goals are the following:

1.	Add comments, which I know everybody hates
2.  Re-factor the light sensing behaviors so they use a base class.  This should be more efficient since the code across these three 
	classes is almost the same.
3.  Optimize any other pre-existing code blocks.
4.	Add features that we think may be useful.
		a.  I don't know what those features are yet.
